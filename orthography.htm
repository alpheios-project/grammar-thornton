    <h2>ORTHOGRAPHY AND ORTHOËPY.</h2>
    
   <p><a id="sect1"><strong>1.</strong></a> Arabic is written from right to left with twenty-eight
    letters, all consonants; three of which, however, are also used as
    vowels. In modern alphabetical order they range as follows, each
     with the equivalent employed by Wright's <em>Arabic Grammar</em>:
the second equivalent (if any) is from <em>Elementary Arabic: First
reading book</em>; being easier for beginners, as Dr Wright discards
digraphs, i. e. two letters for the representation of one sound.</p>
REM. a.  أ following ل forms لا  lâm' alif which is sometimes
reckoned as a letter.<br>
REM. e.  ي  و  أ  are called  حُرُوفُ الْعِلَّةِ  <em>the weak letters.</em><br>
   
   <p><a id="sect2"><strong>2.</strong></a> The orthoëpy, i.e correct pronunciation, of Arabic consonants
is most easily acquired by learning from a Moslem to read
the Corân alound. With the exception of minute and insignificant
divergencies this Corânic pronunciation is in theory identical
nearly* everywhere, though in India, and probably in countries
still more remote from Arabia, its distinctness has fallen off, and
still more remote letters, notabley  ع and  ح is lost. Further,
the Corân's vowelling is beyond dispute; and this is of more
advantage to beginners than they are at first capable of recognizing;
vowel- signs exits, and are used, for purposes of grammar
rather than to aid colloquial pronunciation. Slight indications
only as to Corânic pronunciation can here be given, together with
an explanation of the transliteration to be employed.<br>
 <hr>
*<span style="font-size: small;">A Turkish 'imâm will pronounce certain letters as in Turkish; thus
   kyâmil for  كَامِل kâmil <em>one who is perfect.</em></span><br>
<p><strong>b r f l m h </strong>are pronounced as in English, but r must be trilled and h
distinctly uttered, however placed: thus  مَهْدِيّ mahdîy <em>one
led aright</em> almost mahĭdîy, and  وَجْه wajh <em>face</em> like wajhĭ.</p>
<p><strong>t d</strong> sharper than in English, and with the tongue's tip, to
distinguish them from</p>
<p><strong>ṭ ḍ</strong> pronounced with broad of tongue, the tip being held against
the lower teeth.</p>
<p><strong>ṯẖ</strong> as in thorn, thump; but th as in goatherd, lighthouse.</p>
<p><strong>j</strong> is pronounced (i) ĵ as in John Jim Jack at al Azhar (the
famous Cairo University), but (ii) at the mosques of
Damascus, Tunis and Algiers [jcaron] ز as s in usual, measure,
vision,and as z in azure, and j in adjoin, adjective, adjacent,
bijou; and g in lodge, prestige, singe. The former sound is
represented by Frenchmen with dj and by Germans with
dsch, if now we double  ج thus  سَجَّادَةٌ <em>a prayer-carpet</em>,
it is easy to say sa[jcaron][jcaron] âdaħ, but not saĵĵâdaħ:
the French [jcaron] of bijou is therefore more convenient. Turks
however pronounce this letter as ĵ, and (iii) most Egyptians
colloquially as the g of go, which last is the sound given in
Hebrew.</p>
<p><strong>ḥ</strong> can only be learned by ear: beginners must use h until they
catch the sound.</p>
<p><strong>ḵẖ</strong> has long been employed by Anglo- Indians for the final
sound, harshly said, of lough, loch; gh being required for
 غَيْن  ghain and ch wanted in Persian etc. for the final
consonant of beach, which were best transcribed bîc, i.e
with the Italian c in dolce: kh must sound as in blockhouse,
thickheaded. Be it observed that  خ is not a k but an h,
which cannot in Hebrew writing be distinguished from ح </p>
<p><strong>ḏẖ</strong> is as th in though, thee, this; being as 𝛿 of modern Greece:
but dh as in bedhangings, adhesion.</p>
<p><strong>ẓ</strong> is strictly th said far back: but usually as z pronounced
with the tongue's tip pressed against the lower teeth; then</p>
<p><strong>z</strong> must be sounded sharply to make a distinction.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong> sounds as in kiss:  مُسْلِم  <em>Moslem</em> (quasi-mosslem) is muslim
 the first syllable of which resembles that of muzzle -im
neither in vowel nor consonant. If hissed with the tongue's
tip s contrasts with</p>
<p><strong>ç </strong> which must be pronounced further back, and with broad of tongue.</p>
<p><strong>sẖ</strong> as in shore, wash; but sh as in mishap. For sh the French
use ch and Germans sch, which last represents in Dutch سخ skh.</p>
<p><strong>ʿ</strong> must be learnt by ear. The arrangement of throat is the
same as that required for ḥ but without aspirate. To
mimic baby camels is best of all; otherwise one must repeat
words in which  عَيْن  ain occurs between two vowels, as
 فَعَلَ  fa'ala, <em>he did</em>,  فَعَلَتْ فَعَلْتَ فَعَلْتِ فَعَلْتُ etc. (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect369">§ 369</a>, Table 1).</p>
<p><strong>gẖ</strong> is the sound o gargling; but gh as in foghorn with the Persian كَى gâf, thus كَه gh.</p>
 <p><strong>q</strong> in Arabia is commonly pronounced as g in go, and so may
be said at first; but the student will learn to harden g in
the direction of k, and must sound</p>
<p><strong>k</strong> very sharply in contrast. No one who can recite the Corân
like a Moslem at mosque will confuse  ك  and  ق  as do
uninstructed Europeans.</p>
<p><strong>n</strong> as in English,  نك nk being as in sank, sink; but  نب  nb
sounds mb, thus  مِنْبَر  <em>a pulpit</em>, called mimbar.</p>
<p><strong>w y </strong> are always consonants, as  وَزِير  wazîr <em>burden bearer</em>, سَوَاكِن 
 sawâkin <em>(Souakim) female inhabitants</em>,  يُوسُف  yûsuf <em>Joseph</em>;
but, as these three examples show,  ي و ا  are frequently
 letters of prolongation (see <a href="#sect6">§ 6</a>).</p>
 <p><strong>ħ</strong> representing ة and  ـة  is sounded as h when final, and as t
  when followed by a vowel: it is called  تَآءٌ مَرْبُوطَةٌ tâ'
  marbûṭaħ  <em>tied</em>, as distinguished from ت t,  تَآءٌ مَمْدُودَةٌtâ'
  mamdûdaħ <em>stretched</em> (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect294">§ 294</a> rem. b)</p>
 <hr width="50%">
 <p><a id="sect4"><strong>4.</strong></a> The vowels and diphthongs are as follows:</p>
 <p>  ــَـ      فَتْحَةٌ    a   as vowel sound in aunt, wan, thumb, hat.</p>
 <p>  ــِـ      كَسْرَةٌ    i   as vowel sound in pin, bit, gift.</p>
 <p>  ــُـ       ضَمَّةٌ    u   as vowel sound in push, bull, mustache.</p>
 <p>           ـَا     â   as vowel sound in father, hard.</p>
 <p>           يِ      î   as vowel sound in keep, beach, chief, seize.</p>
 <p>           وُ     û    as vowel sound in moon, rule, blue, you.</P>
  <p>         يِ       ai   as vowel sound in aisle, my, rule, sigh, die, I.</p>
  <p>         وَ      au    as vowel sound in thou, how, bough.</p>
   <p>        ىَ      a   is as â.</p>
   <p>         ً     an   tanwîn of fatḥaħ (see <a href="#sect8">§ 8</a>).</p>
   <p>         ِ     in   tanwîn of kasraħ (see <a href="#sect8">§ 8</a>).</p>
   <p>           ٌ    un   tanwîn of ḍammaħ (see <a href="#sect8">§ 8</a>).</p>
   <p>        ىً      an   as an, but in pause as â (see <a href="#sect27">§ 27</a>).</p>
   <p>      اٍ       an̂ as an, but in pause as â (see <a href="#sect27">§ 27</a>).</p>
<p>REM. a. The three Arabic words above are names of the
 vowel-marks, the corresponding sounds being called كَسْرٌ فَتْحٌ and ضَمُّ <br>
  REM. b. A vowel is called  حَرَكَةٌ <em>a motion</em>, its mark being
   termed  شَكْلٌ  <em>form</em> or <em>figure</em>, plural أَسْكَالٌ and  .شُكُولٌ  Hence
   a consonant when followed by a vowel is said to be  مُتَحَرِكٌ  <em>in motion</em>.</p>
   <p><a id="sect5"><strong>5.</strong></a> When the Corân is recited, each letter, whatever its
relative position, in theory represents the same sound; but in
practice certain consonants somewhat modify adjacent vowels,
for instance  ق ظ ط ض ص  cause â, following one of them, to
be sounded like the Scandinavian å, which we represent variously
in nor, saw, war, hall, wrath, ought, caught. As to the many
jargons which constitute colloquial Arabic, they show divergencies
too materials to be learnt from any book: pronunciation of each
of these spoken dialects (they are unwritten) is easy to an
Englishman who can read aloud the Corânic extracts of <em>Elementary
 Arabic: First reading book</em> uttering the consonants like a
Moslem at mosque; but it must be acquired by ear at the
particular locality simultaneously with all eccentricities of
 vocabulary and grammar*.<br>
 
 <hr>
 *<span style="font-size: small;">Attempts have been made to print the Maltese dialect of Arabic in
Roman character at Valetta, and by the Bible Society in London, but in
neither case does the work betray a knowledge of philology. Far more
scholarly is the following book, which will be found most useful on the
Lower Nile;—“The Modern Egyptian Dialect of Arabic. A Grammar, with
Exercises, Reading-Lessons and Glossaries, from the German of Dr K. Vollers
With numerous additions by the Author. Translated by F. C. Burkitt, M. A.,
 Trinity College. Cambridge: at the University Press, 1895.”</span></p>
 
 <p><a id="sect6"><strong>6.</strong></a> The long vowels â, î, û are indicated (see <a href="#sect4">§ 4</a>) by marking
the corresponding short vowels before و ا and ي respectively,
  which are then called  حُرُوفُ الْمَدِّ  <em>letters of prolongation</em>.</p>
<p>REM.a. In certain common words â is indicated merely by
fatḥaħ; as  اللهُ  etc., which should properly be written with the
 perpendicular fatḥaħ, thus اَللُّهُ <em>God</em>,  هرُونُ  <em>Aaron</em>,  اَلرَّحْمنُ <em>the
 merciful</em>,  اَلسَّموَاتُ <em>the heavens</em>,  اَلْقِيمَةُ <em>the resurrestion</em>,  لكِنْ <em>but</em>,
 ذلِكَ <em>that</em>,  هذَا <em>this</em> etc.: the words  ثَلَاثٌ <em>three</em>,  ثَلَاثُونَ <em>thirty</em>,
 ثَمَانِيةٌ  <em>eight</em>,  ثَمَانُونَ  <em>eighty</em> and  إِسْرَئِيلُ  <em>Israel</em> are also written
 defectively, thus ثَمنُونَ ثَمنِيةٌ ثَلقُونَ ثَلثٌ and إِسْرَائِلُ </p>
 
 <p><a id="sect7"><strong>7.</strong></a> Fatḥaħ before ي and و forms the diphthongs ai and au
(see <a href="#sect4">§ 4</a>). Colloquial pronunciation however, frequently gives
  ai as ei in vein, reign, neighbour, thus شَيْخ as sheikh  <em>elder, chief</em>,
  بَيْت  as beit <em>house, family, verse</em>, اِثْنَيْنِ (oblique case of اِثْنَانِ ) as
  ithnein <em>two</em>.<p>
<p>NOTE. The vowel sound in vein were better represented by ê,
whereas  ي  ai should remain a diphthong as in the French
 word pays (nearly)  pêî in contrast to the French letter p (nearly) pê.<br>
REM. a. A superfluous  ا  is written after  و  at the end of
certain verbal forms: it is useful in manuscript to prevent the و 
 seeming separate and so being mistaken for  وَ   and.<br>
REM. b. At the end of a word  ى   following upon fatḥaħ (i.e a
 see <a href="#sect4">§ 4</a>) is pronounced as  ا  â, so that  عَلَى  'ala  <em>upon</em> and  عَلَا  alâ
 <em>to be high</em> scan the same. When in this position ا and ى are
 called  اَلْأَلِفُ الْمَقْصُورَةُ  <em>the 'alif that can be abbreviated</em>, because
they are shortened in pronunciation if followed by a connective 
 álif (see <a href="#sect18">§ 18</a>); thus  عَلَى اللهِ  <em>upon God</em> and  عَلَا اللهُ  <em>God has
 ascended</em> are both in pause (see <a href="#sect27">§ 27</a>) pronounced 'alallâh. The
 interposition of hamzaħ (see <a href="#sect15">§ 15</a>) prevents this waçl <em>union</em>,
 thus  عَلَلآءُ الدِّينِ 'alâ'u -1 dîni (<em>Aladdin</em>) <em>the sublimity of religion</em>.
The 'alif maqçûraħ, however written, is quiescent (see <a href="#sect9">§ 9</a> rem. a)
al also are  و  of  وْ  au and  ي of  يْ  ai. When attached to
 tanwîn, radical final 'alif is quiescent, thus  عَصًا  <em>a stick</em> (see
 <a href="etymology.htm#sect212">§ 212</a> b); but it is also maqçûaħ in  اَلعَصَا  <em>the stick</em>.<br>

REM. c. If a pronominal suffix be added to a word ending in
 ى  as  نَرَى  <em>we see</em>, the  ى  is sometimes retained, but more often
is changed into  ا  as  نَرَاكَ  for  نَرَيكَ  or  نَريكَ (all pronounced)
 narâka  <em>we see thee</em>.<br>
REM.d. Some words ending in  اة  âħ may be written وة 
 or وة  as حَيَوةٌ  or  حَيوةٌ  <em>life</em>, صَلَوةٌ  or  صَلوةٌ  <em>prayer</em>, زَكَوةٌ or زَكوةٌ 
 <em>alms</em>: further we find ية or ية for اة in the loan word
 تَوْرَيةٌ  or  تَوْريةٌ  <em>Old Testament</em>.</p>
 
  <p><a id="sect8"><strong>8.</strong></a> Marks of the short vowels when doubled at the end of a
word (see <a href="#sect4">§ 4</a>) are pronounced thus  ً an, ٍ in,  ٌ un, which
   is called  تَنْوِينٌ tanwînun <em>adding of the letter nûn</em>.</p>
<p>REM. a. Tanwîn of fatḥaħ takes ا  after all consonants except
 ة as بَابًا <em>quite</em>, but سِنَةً <em>drousiness</em> (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect308">§ 308</a>). When preceding
  ى it requires no ا as هُدًى <em>guidance</em>. Notwithstanding this' alif,
 the vowel is short: thus bâban̂ (not ân), but in pause (see <a href="#sect27">§ 27</a>)
<lb/>bâbâ. We transliterate بَابًا bâban̂ and سِنَةً sinaħan, but an̂ and
an are pronounced alike; except in pause, when an is not heard,
whereas an̂ sounds as â. In pause sinaħan is read sinah (see
 end of <a href="#sect2"> § 2</a>).</p>
   
<p>The following orthographic signs are also use:</p>
<hr width="50%">
 <p><a id="sect9"><strong>9.</strong></a> Sukûn <em>rest</em>  ـْـ  is placed over the final consonant of all
  shut syllables (see <a href="#sect25">§ 25</a>).<br>
REM. a. A consnant which has no following vowel is called
  حَرْفٌ سَاكِنٌ  <em>a quiescent letter</em> (see <a href="#sect4">§ 4</a> rem. b).<br>
REM. b. Letters that are assimilated to a following letter,
  which receive in consequence tashdîd (see <a href="#sect11">§ 11</a>), are retained
in writing but are not marked with sukûn; thus اَللَّغَةُ <em>the
  language</em>,  أضرَدتُّ pronounced 'arattu (see <a href="#sect14">§ 14</a> c).</p>
<p><a id="sect10"><strong>10.</strong></a> When part of a diphthong ي and و take sukûn, but this
sign is very unusual over 'alif maqçûraħ (see <a href="#sect7"> § 7</a> rem. b) or
other letter of prolongation.</p>
 <p><a id="sect11"><strong>11.</strong></a> Tashdîd <em>strengthening</em>  ــّـ  is marked over a double consonant
and the letter's repetition saved; thus  بَدَّلَ   baddala <em>to
  substitute</em>,  اَلْكُلُّ  al kullu <em>the whole</em>.<br>
REM. c. Hamzaħ (see <a href="#sect15"> § 15</a>) may be doubled and take tashdîd,
  thus  سَأَّالٌ  sa” âlun <em>a mendicant</em> from  سَأَلَ  sa'ala <em>to ask</em>.</p>
 
 <p><a id="sect14"><strong>14.</strong></a> The euphonic tashdid follows a vowelless consonant,
which, though expressed in writing, is passed over in pronunciation, in order to
avoid a harshness of sound, and assimilated to a following consonant. It is used:—<br>
(a) With the letters  ن ل ظ ط ض ص ش س ز ر ذ د ث ت  after  اَلْ  the (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect345">§ 345</a>).<br>
REM. a. These letters are called  اَلْحُرُوفُ الشَّمسِشَّةُ  <em>the solar
  letters</em> because  شَمْسٌ  <em>sun</em> begins with one of them, and for an
analogous reason all other consonants are called اَلْحُرُوفُ الْقَمَرِيَّةُ 
  <em>the lunar letters</em> from  قَمَرٌ  <em>moon</em>.<br>
(b) With the letters  ي و م ل ر  after n with sukûn, as
  مِن رَّبِّهِ  <em>from his Lord</em>,  كِتَابٌ مُّبِينٌ  <em>a perspicuous book</em>, which
are read mirrabbihi, kitâbummubînun. The n of the words
  أَنْ عَنْ مِنْ  is often not written when they are combined with مَنْ مَا or لَا <br>

  REM. b. We may write  أَنْ لَا  or  أَن لَّ  or أَلَّ <em>that not</em>, and إِلَّا 
  for إِن لَّا <em>it not</em>; but عَمَّا <em>from what</em> is better so written for
  عَنْ مَا  as is إِمَّا for  إِنْ  مَا  <em>if</em> with نَا الزَّائِدَةُ <em>redundant mâ</em>
(see <a href="etymology.htm#sect353">§ 353</a>*).<br>
(c) With he letter ت after ظ ط ض ذ د ث in certain parts
  of the verb, as  أَرَدتُّ  <em>I wished</em>: this practice is, however, more
  than questionable.</br>
REM. b. If the verb ends in ت it naturally unites with a
second  ت  as نَبَّتَّ nabbattu <em>I sowed</em> or <em>planted</em> for نَبَّتْتُ </p>
<p><a id="sect15"><strong>15.</strong></a> Hamzaħ <em>compression (of upper part of windpipe)</em>  ء to
 which a 'alif most commonly serves as  عِمَادٌ 'imâd <em>support</em>, may
almost be reckoned by Europeans as the alphabet's initial consonant.
It is equivalent to the French h aspirée (which to English
sense is not, except in Normandy, sounded),and it may be
heard between the two words le onze and between la onzième.
If our own definite article be pronounced before a vowel as before
a consonant, we can only prevent liaison by employing hamzaħ;
thus thö 'orange (ö as E in the book). Arabs would transcribe
a nice house anaishaus but an'aishaus for an ice house.<br>
REM. a. When a connective 'alif (see <a href="#sect18">§ 18</a>) requires vowelling,
 the vowel mark is better written without hamazaħ, thus اَلْ <em>the</em>,
 اِبْنٌ  <em>son</em>  (see <a href="#sect19">§ 19</a>rem. d).<br>
REM. c. Hamzaħ is marked btween ا and sukûn or the
 following vowel; but we find  مَلَئِهِ  <em>his chiefs</em>,  خَاشِئينَ  <em>object</em>,
 and even  بَئشٌ  <em>griexous</em>.<br>
REM. d. Hamzaħ is most perceptible in the middle of a
word as  اَلْقُرْآنُ for (see <a href="#sect23">§ 23</a>)  اَلْقُرْأَانُ  al qur'ânu (not qurânu)
 <em>the Corân</em>.<br>
 REM. e. Hamzaħ and 'alif are called  أَلِفُ الْقَطْعِ  <em>the 'alif of severance</em>.</p>

<p><a id="sect16"><strong>16.</strong></a> We have spoken in the preceding section of 'alif serving
most commonly as 'imâd to hamzaħ; in certain circumstances this
position may be taken by  و  or ى the latter appearing without
 dots (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect131">§§ 131</a> et seq., <a href="etymology.htm#sect238">238</a>, <a href="etymology.htm#sect240"> 240</a>, <a href="etymology.htm#sect316">316</a> <em>d</em> and <a href="etymology.htm#sect361">361</a> <em>a</em> rem.), thus
 مُنْشِىءٌ  <em>producer</em>.</p>
<p><a id="sect17"><strong>17.</strong></a> Hamzaħ alone, instead of ؤ إ أ or ىء is written,<br>
(a) always at a word's end, after sukûn or a letter of prolongation,
 as  جَاءَ  <em>he came</em>,  سُوءٌ  <em>evil</em>,  مَجِيءٌ  <em>a coming</em>,  ظِمْءٌ  <em>thirst</em>;
and in the middle of a word after 'alif of prolongation provided
 the hamzaħ bears fatḥaħ as acc.  أَعْدَاءَكُمْ  <em>your enemies</em>, but nom.
 أَعْدَآؤُكُمْ , dep.  أَعْدآئِكُمْ <br>
Note. For أَعْدَآءَكُمْ جَآءَ see <a href="#sect22">§ 22</a>, and for  مَجِيءٌ سُوءٌ   see
<a href="#sect23">§ 23</a> rem. c.<br>
(b) frequently in the middle of words after و or ي of prolongation
 and after sukûn, as  سُوءَى  <em>a mischief</em> for مَشِيئَةٌ سُوؤَى 
 <em>wish</em> for  مَشِيئَةٌ يَسْئَلُ <em>he asks</em> for يَسْأَلُ ; also after kasraħ and
 ḍammah before ي  or  و  of prolongation;  خَاطِئينَ  khâ⃛i'îna <em>sinners</em>
 for  رُءُوسٌ خَاطِئِينَ  ru'ûsun  <em>heads</em> for رُؤُوشٌ Sometimes it is
improperly placed over the letter of prolongation, as خَطِيَةٌ for
 خَطِيَةٌ   or   خَطِيئَةٌ   kha⃛î'aħun   <em>sin</em>.<br>
 REM b. Hamzaħ may under certain circumstances be changed
into a weak letter, as مِيةٌ for مِئَةٌ (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect325">§ 325</a> rem. a),  نَبِيُّ  for
 نَبِيءٌ  <em>prophet</em>, فَيٌّ for فَيْءٌ  <em>shade</em>,  رَاسٌ  for  رَأْسٌ  <em>head</em>, بِيرٌ  for  بِئْرٌ  
 <em>a cistern</em>,  أَالِهَةٌ  for  أَأْلِهَةٌ  <em>gods</em>,  أَامَنَّاfor  أَأْمَنَّا   <em>we believed</em>.<br>
NOTE.  For  آمَنَّا آلِهَةٌ  see <a href="#sect23">§ 23</a>, and for  مَشِيئَةٌ سُوءَى   rem. c.<br>
 REM. c. The name  دَآءُودُ  <em>David</em> is always pronounced dâ'ûd
 however it may be written.</p>
<p><a id="sect18"><strong>18.</strong></a> Some Arabic words begin with connective 'alif over
 which is marked  waçlaħ  <em>sign of union</em> ~ hereinafter transliterated
by hyphen, because the word and its predecessor are spoken as
 one; thus  عَبْدُ اللهِ  'abdu -llâhi  <em>servant of God</em>,  وَادْعُوهُ  wa -d'ûhu
 <em>and call ye upon Him</em>.</p>
<p><a id="sect19"><strong>19.</strong></a> Elision takes place to form the union<br>
 (a) with the vowel of  اَلْ  <em>the</em>, as  يَوْمُ الدِّينِ  <em>the day of the judgment</em>.<br>
NOTE. As regards  اَلَّذِي  see <a href="etymology.htm#sect347">§ 347</a>.<br>
 (b) in regular Imperatives of the first form, as  قَالَ اصْبِرْ  <em>he said, Be patient</em>; instead of اِصْبِرْ <br>
(c) in certain derivatives belonging to the seventh and following
forms of the verbs (see <a href="#sect35">§ 35</a>), as وَانْقَلَبُوا  <em>and they were changed</em>; instead of اِنْقَلَبُوا <br>
 (d) in  اِبْنٌ  <em>son</em>,  اِثْنَانِ  <em>two</em>,  اِمْرَأَةٌ <em>a woman</em>,  اِسْمٌ  <em>name</em>, and a
few other nouns.<br>
REM. c. In most of these words the 'alif and vowel are prosthetic,
i. e. prefixed to a vowelless initial consonant' for the sake
of euphony (see <a href="#sect26">§ 26</a ).<br>
 
 REM. d. It is obviously an error to begin a sentence with ~آ 
 in such case the connective 'alif is written without hamzaħ but
 with a vowel, as  اَلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ  <em>Praise belongs to God</em>.<br>
 REM. f. Waçlaħ and 'alif are called  أَلِفُ الْوَصْلِ  <em>the 'alif of union</em>.</p>
<p><a id="sect20"><strong>20.</strong></a> The connective 'alif may follow<br>
(a) a short vowel, which then absorbs it (see <a href="#sect18">§ 18</a>).<br>
(b) a long vowel, which is then shortened in pronunciation
to comply with  <a href="#sect25">§ 25</a>; as  فِى الْأَرْضِfî -l 'arḍi to be read fil'arḍi
 <em>in the earth</em>,  اِ هْدِنَا الصِّراَطَihdinâ -l çirâ⃛a to be read ihdinaççirâ⃛a
 <em>guide us (on) the way</em>: but the suffixes of the 1st pers. sing.
 يِ  and  نِي   may assume before the article the order forms
 ي and  نِىَ  as  أُدْخُلْ بِيَ الْبَيْتَ  <em>cause me to enter the house</em>,
   سَأَصْرِقُ عَنْ آيَاتِىَ الَّذِينَ    (or آيَاتِي  الَّذِينَ)   <em>I will divert from
 my signs those who</em>.<br>     
(c) a diphthong, which usually is resolved into two simple
 vowels; but  أَوْ  <em>or</em> and لَوْ  <em>if</em> take kasra, thus ضَمِيرُ التَّوْكِيدِ أّوِ 
 التَّأْكِيدِ  <em>the pronoun of corroboration </em> (see <a href="syntax.htm#sect530">§ 530</a>).<br>
(d) sukûn over a consonant, which then most usually takes
 kasraħ, as  فِى الاِبْتِدَآءِ  for  فِي الْ اِبْتِدَآءِ  <em>in the beginning</em>, مُحَمَّدٌ 
 النَّبِيُّ  (sometimes written  مُحَمَّدٌ نِ النَّبِيُّ ) <em>Mahomet the prophet</em>
 pronounced muḥammaduninnabîyu,  جُمْلَةٌ اسْمِيَّةٌ  <em>a nominal sentence</em>
 (see <a href="syntax.htm#sect513">§ 513</a>)  وَلكِنِ انْظُرُ  <em>but look</em>. The pronouns  أَنْتُمْ  <em>you</em>,
 هُمْ  <em>they</em>; the suffixes  كُمْ  <em>your, you</em>,  هُمْ  <em>their, them</em>; and the
verbal termination  تُمْ  take ḍammaħ (in which they originally
 ended), as  لَعَنَهُمُ اللهُ   <em>may God curse them</em> (see <a href="syntax.htm#sect401">§ 401</a> f) : also
 مُذْ   <em>since</em> because contracted for  مُنْذُ  whereas  مِنْ  <em>from</em>(see
<a href="syntax.htm#sect448">§ 448</a>) takes fatḥaħ before the article and elsewhere kasraħ.<br>
 REM. a.  When  هُمْ  becomes  هِمْ (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect185">§ 185</a> rem. b) the waçl
 may be made with ḍammaħ  هِمُ  or kasraħ هِمِ </p>
<p><a id="sect21"><strong>21.</strong></a> The آ is altogether omitted<br>
(a) from  اِسْمٌ  in the formula  بِسْمِ اللهِ  for  بِاسْمِ اللهِ  <em>in the
 name of God</em>, which by way of compensation is written بسم  <br>
(b) from  اِبْنٌ  in a genealogical series, with certain exceptions.<br>
 (c) from  اَلْ  <em>the</em> preceded by  لِ  to (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect356">§ 356</a> c) as لِلْبَيَانِ 
 <em>to the explanation</em> for  oW^J ; or J  <em>verily</em> (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect361">§ 361</a> c) as J»-j«U 
 <em>certainly the man</em> for لاِلرَّجُلُ . When three lâms occur one is
 omitted, thus  لِلَّهِ   <em>to God</em> for لِاللهِ <br>
(d) from words preceded by the interrogative particle I (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect361">§ 361</a> a).</p>

 <p><a id="sect22"><strong>22.</strong></a> Maddaħ <em>extension</em>  ~ does not admit of transliteration,
being either superfluous or an abbreviation or marking an
abbreviation. Thus it is customary to omit 'alif which, with
hamzaħ and a vowel or tanwîn, follows a 'alif of prolongation;
 then by way of compensation maddaħ is written over the remaining
  'alif, as  سَآئِلٌ  <em>one who asks</em> for  جَآءَ شَاإِلٌ  <em>he came</em> for جَاأض 
  أَعْدَآءَكُمْ  <em>your enemies</em> for أَعْدَاأّكُمْ </p>

 <p><a id="sect23"><strong>23.</strong></a> Maddaħ and 'alif آ also represent a 'alif with hamzaħ
and fatḥaħ followed by 'alif of prolongation أَا or by 'alif with
  hamzaħ and sukûn  أَأْ  as  آلَ  <em>he returned</em> for أَالَ ءَآلَ آيَةٌ  <em>a sign</em>,
  <em>verse</em> for  أَايَةٌ  for  آلهِةٌ، أَوَيَةٌ <em>gods</em> for آمَنَّا، أّأْلِهَةُ  <em>we believed</em> for أّأْمّنَّا 
  سَيِّآتٌ  for  سَيِّئَاتٌ  plural of  سَيِّئَةٌ  <em>an evil</em> (see  <a href="etymology.htm#sect242">§ 242</a> Note 2).<br>

REM. c. Maddaħ is sometimes placed over و and ي of prolongation
when followed by hamzaħ, as سُوءَى، مَجِيءٌ، سُوءٌ 
  مَشِيئَةٌ : it serves in manuscript to prevent hamzaħ appearing to
be upon the letter of prolongation.<br>
REM. d. The same mark  ~ is written over abbreviations, as
  الخ  for <em>to its end</em>  i.e. <em>etcaetera</em> (see <a href="syntax.htm#sect451">§ 451</a> c).</p>

English the longest.<br>
NOTE. Professor de Goeje appends to vol ii § 95 f of Wright's
Grammar an instructive footnote condemning pedantic speech,
and he gives reference to a MS at Leyden. In fact case-endings
 are nearly always dropped in  اَلدَّارِجُ  al dârij <em>current speech</em>:
throughout Arabia the proper name  اِبْنُ رَشِيدٍ  is pronounced
ibrrashîd by Badawîn (Bedouins). The accusative is most often
 heard, as  مَرْحَبًا  marḥabaû (see <a href="syntax.htm#sect435">§ 435</a> b) welcome pronounced in
 pause marḥabâ (see <a href="#sect8">§ 8</a> rem. a).</p>
<p><a id="sect28"><strong>28.</strong></a> The accent will not occasion difficulty to Englishmen
who acquire pronunciation of Arabic consonants by reading the
<Corân aloud after a Moslem: it is designed to ensure grammatical
accuracy; thus  يُسَبِّخُ  (see <em>Elementary Arabic: First
 reading book</em>, page  26 bottom line) is pronounced yusabbíḥu for
fear of saying yusábbiḥû. Colloquial accentuation differs with  
the locality; thus  مُصْطَفَى اللهِ  muçṭafa -llâhi <em>chosen of God</em> is
múçṭafa in Syria, and in Egypt muçṭáfa or even muçṭâfa.</p>

the last two words, being supplementary to the Hebrew and
Aramaic alphabets. Between the analysis and text of <em>Elementary
