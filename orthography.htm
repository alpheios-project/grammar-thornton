    <h2>ORTHOGRAPHY AND ORTHOËPY.</h2>
    
   <p><a id="sect1"><strong>1.</strong></a> Arabic is written from right to left with twenty-eight
    letters, all consonants; three of which, however, are also used as
    vowels. In modern alphabetical order they range as follows, each
     with the equivalent employed by Wright's <em>Arabic Grammar</em>:
the second equivalent (if any) is from <em>Elementary Arabic: First
reading book</em>; being easier for beginners, as Dr Wright discards
digraphs, i. e. two letters for the representation of one sound.</p>
REM. a.  أ following ل forms لا  lâm' alif which is sometimes
reckoned as a letter.<br>
REM. e.  ي  و  أ  are called  حُرُوفُ الْعِلَّةِ  <em>the weak letters.</em><br>
   
   <p><a id="sect2"><strong>2.</strong></a> The orthoëpy, i.e correct pronunciation, of Arabic consonants
is most easily acquired by learning from a Moslem to read
the Corân alound. With the exception of minute and insignificant
divergencies this Corânic pronunciation is in theory identical
nearly* everywhere, though in India, and probably in countries
still more remote from Arabia, its distinctness has fallen off, and
still more remote letters, notabley  ع and  ح is lost. Further,
the Corân's vowelling is beyond dispute; and this is of more
advantage to beginners than they are at first capable of recognizing;
vowel- signs exits, and are used, for purposes of grammar
rather than to aid colloquial pronunciation. Slight indications
only as to Corânic pronunciation can here be given, together with
an explanation of the transliteration to be employed.<br>
 <hr>
*<span style="font-size: small;">A Turkish 'imâm will pronounce certain letters as in Turkish; thus
   kyâmil for  كَامِل kâmil <em>one who is perfect.</em></span><br>
<p><strong>b r f l m h </strong>are pronounced as in English, but r must be trilled and h
distinctly uttered, however placed: thus  مَهْدِيّ mahdîy <em>one
led aright</em> almost mahĭdîy, and  وَجْه wajh <em>face</em> like wajhĭ.</p>
<p><strong>t d</strong> sharper than in English, and with the tongue's tip, to
distinguish them from</p>
<p><strong>ṭ ḍ</strong> pronounced with broad of tongue, the tip being held against
the lower teeth.</p>
<p><strong>ṯẖ</strong> as in thorn, thump; but th as in goatherd, lighthouse.</p>
<p><strong>j</strong> is pronounced (i) ĵ as in John Jim Jack at al Azhar (the
famous Cairo University), but (ii) at the mosques of
Damascus, Tunis and Algiers [jcaron] ز as s in usual, measure,
vision,and as z in azure, and j in adjoin, adjective, adjacent,
bijou; and g in lodge, prestige, singe. The former sound is
represented by Frenchmen with dj and by Germans with
dsch, if now we double  ج thus  سَجَّادَةٌ <em>a prayer-carpet</em>,
it is easy to say sa[jcaron][jcaron] âdaħ, but not saĵĵâdaħ:
the French [jcaron] of bijou is therefore more convenient. Turks
however pronounce this letter as ĵ, and (iii) most Egyptians
colloquially as the g of go, which last is the sound given in
Hebrew.</p>
<p><strong>ḥ</strong> can only be learned by ear: beginners must use h until they
catch the sound.</p>
<p><strong>ḵẖ</strong> has long been employed by Anglo- Indians for the final
sound, harshly said, of lough, loch; gh being required for
 غَيْن  ghain and ch wanted in Persian etc. for the final
consonant of beach, which were best transcribed bîc, i.e
with the Italian c in dolce: kh must sound as in blockhouse,
thickheaded. Be it observed that  خ is not a k but an h,
which cannot in Hebrew writing be distinguished from ح </p>
<p><strong>ḏẖ</strong> is as th in though, thee, this; being as 𝛿 of modern Greece:
but dh as in bedhangings, adhesion.</p>
<p><strong>ẓ</strong> is strictly th said far back: but usually as z pronounced
with the tongue's tip pressed against the lower teeth; then</p>
<p><strong>z</strong> must be sounded sharply to make a distinction.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong> sounds as in kiss:  مُسْلِم  <em>Moslem</em> (quasi-mosslem) is muslim
 the first syllable of which resembles that of muzzle -im
neither in vowel nor consonant. If hissed with the tongue's
tip s contrasts with</p>
<p><strong>ç </strong> which must be pronounced further back, and with broad of tongue.</p>
<p><strong>sẖ</strong> as in shore, wash; but sh as in mishap. For sh the French
use ch and Germans sch, which last represents in Dutch سخ skh.</p>
<p><strong>ʿ</strong> must be learnt by ear. The arrangement of throat is the
same as that required for ḥ but without aspirate. To
mimic baby camels is best of all; otherwise one must repeat
words in which  عَيْن  ain occurs between two vowels, as
 فَعَلَ  fa'ala, <em>he did</em>,  فَعَلَتْ فَعَلْتَ فَعَلْتِ فَعَلْتُ etc. (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect369">§ 369</a>, Table 1).</p>
<p><strong>gẖ</strong> is the sound o gargling; but gh as in foghorn with the Persian كَى gâf, thus كَه gh.</p>
 <p><strong>q</strong> in Arabia is commonly pronounced as g in go, and so may
be said at first; but the student will learn to harden g in
the direction of k, and must sound</p>
<p><strong>k</strong> very sharply in contrast. No one who can recite the Corân
like a Moslem at mosque will confuse  ك  and  ق  as do
uninstructed Europeans.</p>
<p><strong>n</strong> as in English,  نك nk being as in sank, sink; but  نب  nb
sounds mb, thus  مِنْبَر  <em>a pulpit</em>, called mimbar.</p>
<p><strong>w y </strong> are always consonants, as  وَزِير  wazîr <em>burden bearer</em>, سَوَاكِن 
 sawâkin <em>(Souakim) female inhabitants</em>,  يُوسُف  yûsuf <em>Joseph</em>;
but, as these three examples show,  ي و ا  are frequently
 letters of prolongation (see <a href="#sect6">§ 6</a>).</p>
 <p><strong>ħ</strong> representing ة and  ـة  is sounded as h when final, and as t
  when followed by a vowel: it is called  تَآءٌ مَرْبُوطَةٌ tâ'
  marbûṭaħ  <em>tied</em>, as distinguished from ت t,  تَآءٌ مَمْدُودَةٌtâ'
  mamdûdaħ <em>stretched</em> (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect294">§ 294</a> rem. b)</p>
 <hr width="50%">
 <p><a id="sect4"><strong>4.</strong></a> The vowels and diphthongs are as follows:</p>
 <p>  ــَـ      فَتْحَةٌ    a   as vowel sound in aunt, wan, thumb, hat.</p>
 <p>  ــِـ      كَسْرَةٌ    i   as vowel sound in pin, bit, gift.</p>
 <p>  ــُـ       ضَمَّةٌ    u   as vowel sound in push, bull, mustache.</p>
 <p>           ـَا     â   as vowel sound in father, hard.</p>
 <p>           يِ      î   as vowel sound in keep, beach, chief, seize.</p>
 <p>           وُ     û    as vowel sound in moon, rule, blue, you.</P>
  <p>         يِ       ai   as vowel sound in aisle, my, rule, sigh, die, I.</p>
  <p>         وَ      au    as vowel sound in thou, how, bough.</p>
   <p>        ىَ      a   is as â.</p>
   <p>         ً     an   tanwîn of fatḥaħ (see <a href="#sect8">§ 8</a>).</p>
   <p>         ِ     in   tanwîn of kasraħ (see <a href="#sect8">§ 8</a>).</p>
   <p>           ٌ    un   tanwîn of ḍammaħ (see <a href="#sect8">§ 8</a>).</p>
   <p>        ىً      an   as an, but in pause as â (see <a href="#sect27">§ 27</a>).</p>
   <p>      اٍ       an̂ as an, but in pause as â (see <a href="#sect27">§ 27</a>).</p>
<p>REM. a. The three Arabic words above are names of the
 vowel-marks, the corresponding sounds being called كَسْرٌ فَتْحٌ and ضَمُّ <br>
  REM. b. A vowel is called  حَرَكَةٌ <em>a motion</em>, its mark being
   termed  شَكْلٌ  <em>form</em> or <em>figure</em>, plural أَسْكَالٌ and  .شُكُولٌ  Hence
   a consonant when followed by a vowel is said to be  مُتَحَرِكٌ  <em>in motion</em>.</p>
   <p><a id="sect5"><strong>5.</strong></a> When the Corân is recited, each letter, whatever its
relative position, in theory represents the same sound; but in
practice certain consonants somewhat modify adjacent vowels,
for instance  ق ظ ط ض ص  cause â, following one of them, to
be sounded like the Scandinavian å, which we represent variously
in nor, saw, war, hall, wrath, ought, caught. As to the many
jargons which constitute colloquial Arabic, they show divergencies
too materials to be learnt from any book: pronunciation of each
of these spoken dialects (they are unwritten) is easy to an
Englishman who can read aloud the Corânic extracts of <em>Elementary
 Arabic: First reading book</em> uttering the consonants like a
Moslem at mosque; but it must be acquired by ear at the
particular locality simultaneously with all eccentricities of
 vocabulary and grammar*.<br>
 
 <hr>
 *<span style="font-size: small;">Attempts have been made to print the Maltese dialect of Arabic in
Roman character at Valetta, and by the Bible Society in London, but in
neither case does the work betray a knowledge of philology. Far more
scholarly is the following book, which will be found most useful on the
Lower Nile;—“The Modern Egyptian Dialect of Arabic. A Grammar, with
Exercises, Reading-Lessons and Glossaries, from the German of Dr K. Vollers
With numerous additions by the Author. Translated by F. C. Burkitt, M. A.,
 Trinity College. Cambridge: at the University Press, 1895.”</span></p>
 
 <p><a id="sect6"><strong>6.</strong></a> The long vowels â, î, û are indicated (see <a href="#sect4">§ 4</a>) by marking
the corresponding short vowels before و ا and ي respectively,
  which are then called  حُرُوفُ الْمَدِّ  <em>letters of prolongation</em>.</p>
<p>REM.a. In certain common words â is indicated merely by
fatḥaħ; as  اللهُ  etc., which should properly be written with the
 perpendicular fatḥaħ, thus اَللُّهُ <em>God</em>,  هرُونُ  <em>Aaron</em>,  اَلرَّحْمنُ <em>the
 merciful</em>,  اَلسَّموَاتُ <em>the heavens</em>,  اَلْقِيمَةُ <em>the resurrestion</em>,  لكِنْ <em>but</em>,
 ذلِكَ <em>that</em>,  هذَا <em>this</em> etc.: the words  ثَلَاثٌ <em>three</em>,  ثَلَاثُونَ <em>thirty</em>,
 ثَمَانِيةٌ  <em>eight</em>,  ثَمَانُونَ  <em>eighty</em> and  إِسْرَئِيلُ  <em>Israel</em> are also written
 defectively, thus ثَمنُونَ ثَمنِيةٌ ثَلقُونَ ثَلثٌ and إِسْرَائِلُ </p>
 
 <p><a id="sect7"><strong>7.</strong></a> Fatḥaħ before ي and و forms the diphthongs ai and au
(see <a href="#sect4">§ 4</a>). Colloquial pronunciation however, frequently gives
  ai as ei in vein, reign, neighbour, thus شَيْخ as sheikh  <em>elder, chief</em>,
  بَيْت  as beit <em>house, family, verse</em>, اِثْنَيْنِ (oblique case of اِثْنَانِ ) as
  ithnein <em>two</em>.<p>
<p>NOTE. The vowel sound in vein were better represented by ê,
whereas  ي  ai should remain a diphthong as in the French
 word pays (nearly)  pêî in contrast to the French letter p (nearly) pê.<br>
REM. a. A superfluous  ا  is written after  و  at the end of
certain verbal forms: it is useful in manuscript to prevent the و 
 seeming separate and so being mistaken for  وَ   and.<br>
REM. b. At the end of a word  ى   following upon fatḥaħ (i.e a
 see <a href="#sect4">§ 4</a>) is pronounced as  ا  â, so that  عَلَى  'ala  <em>upon</em> and  عَلَا  alâ
 <em>to be high</em> scan the same. When in this position ا and ى are
 called  اَلْأَلِفُ الْمَقْصُورَةُ  <em>the 'alif that can be abbreviated</em>, because
they are shortened in pronunciation if followed by a connective 
 álif (see <a href="#sect18">§ 18</a>); thus  عَلَى اللهِ  <em>upon God</em> and  عَلَا اللهُ  <em>God has
 ascended</em> are both in pause (see <a href="#sect27">§ 27</a>) pronounced 'alallâh. The
 interposition of hamzaħ (see <a href="#sect15">§ 15</a>) prevents this waçl <em>union</em>,
 thus  عَلَلآءُ الدِّينِ 'alâ'u -1 dîni (<em>Aladdin</em>) <em>the sublimity of religion</em>.
The 'alif maqçûraħ, however written, is quiescent (see <a href="#sect9">§ 9</a> rem. a)
al also are  و  of  وْ  au and  ي of  يْ  ai. When attached to
 tanwîn, radical final 'alif is quiescent, thus  عَصًا  <em>a stick</em> (see
 <a href="etymology.htm#sect212">§ 212</a> b); but it is also maqçûaħ in  اَلعَصَا  <em>the stick</em>.<br>

REM. c. If a pronominal suffix be added to a word ending in
 ى  as  نَرَى  <em>we see</em>, the  ى  is sometimes retained, but more often
is changed into  ا  as  نَرَاكَ  for  نَرَيكَ  or  نَريكَ (all pronounced)
 narâka  <em>we see thee</em>.<br>
REM.d. Some words ending in  اة  âħ may be written وة 
 or وة  as حَيَوةٌ  or  حَيوةٌ  <em>life</em>, صَلَوةٌ  or  صَلوةٌ  <em>prayer</em>, زَكَوةٌ or زَكوةٌ 
 <em>alms</em>: further we find ية or ية for اة in the loan word
 تَوْرَيةٌ  or  تَوْريةٌ  <em>Old Testament</em>.</p>
 
  <p><a id="sect8"><strong>8.</strong></a> Marks of the short vowels when doubled at the end of a
word (see <a href="#sect4">§ 4</a>) are pronounced thus  ً an, ٍ in,  ٌ un, which
   is called  تَنْوِينٌ tanwînun <em>adding of the letter nûn</em>.</p>
<p>REM. a. Tanwîn of fatḥaħ takes ا  after all consonants except
 ة as بَابًا <em>quite</em>, but سِنَةً <em>drousiness</em> (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect308">§ 308</a>). When preceding
  ى it requires no ا as هُدًى <em>guidance</em>. Notwithstanding this' alif,
 the vowel is short: thus bâban̂ (not ân), but in pause (see <a href="#sect27">§ 27</a>)
<lb/>bâbâ. We transliterate بَابًا bâban̂ and سِنَةً sinaħan, but an̂ and
an are pronounced alike; except in pause, when an is not heard,
whereas an̂ sounds as â. In pause sinaħan is read sinah (see
 end of <a href="#sect2"> § 2</a>).</p>
   
<p>The following orthographic signs are also use:</p>
<hr width="50%">
 <p><a id="sect9"><strong>9.</strong></a> Sukûn <em>rest</em>  ـْـ  is placed over the final consonant of all
  shut syllables (see <a href="#sect25">§ 25</a>).<br>
REM. a. A consnant which has no following vowel is called
  حَرْفٌ سَاكِنٌ  <em>a quiescent letter</em> (see <a href="#sect4">§ 4</a> rem. b).<br>
REM. b. Letters that are assimilated to a following letter,
  which receive in consequence tashdîd (see <a href="#sect11">§ 11</a>), are retained
in writing but are not marked with sukûn; thus اَللَّغَةُ <em>the
  language</em>,  أضرَدتُّ pronounced 'arattu (see <a href="#sect14">§ 14</a> c).</p>
<p><a id="sect10"><strong>10.</strong></a> When part of a diphthong ي and و take sukûn, but this
sign is very unusual over 'alif maqçûraħ (see <a href="#sect7"> § 7</a> rem. b) or
other letter of prolongation.</p>
 <p><a id="sect11"><strong>11.</strong></a> Tashdîd <em>strengthening</em>  ــّـ  is marked over a double consonant
and the letter's repetition saved; thus  بَدَّلَ   baddala <em>to
  substitute</em>,  اَلْكُلُّ  al kullu <em>the whole</em>.<br>
REM. c. Hamzaħ (see <a href="#sect15"> § 15</a>) may be doubled and take tashdîd,
  thus  سَأَّالٌ  sa” âlun <em>a mendicant</em> from  سَأَلَ  sa'ala <em>to ask</em>.</p>
 
 <p><a id="sect14"><strong>14.</strong></a> The euphonic tashdid follows a vowelless consonant,
which, though expressed in writing, is passed over in pronunciation, in order to
avoid a harshness of sound, and assimilated to a following consonant. It is used:—<br>
(a) With the letters  ن ل ظ ط ض ص ش س ز ر ذ د ث ت  after  اَلْ  the (see <a href="etymology.htm#sect345">§ 345</a>).<br>
REM. a. These letters are called  اَلْحُرُوفُ الشَّمسِشَّةُ  <em>the solar
  letters</em> because  شَمْسٌ  <em>sun</em> begins with one of them, and for an
analogous reason all other consonants are called اَلْحُرُوفُ الْقَمَرِيَّةُ 
  <em>the lunar letters</em> from  قَمَرٌ  <em>moon</em>.<br>
(b) With the letters  ي و م ل ر  after n with sukûn, as
  مِن رَّبِّهِ  <em>from his Lord</em>,  كِتَابٌ مُّبِينٌ  <em>a perspicuous book</em>, which
are read mirrabbihi, kitâbummubînun. The n of the words
  أَنْ عَنْ مِنْ  is often not written when they are combined with مَنْ مَا or لَا <br>

  REM. b. We may write  أَنْ لَا  or  أَن لَّ  or أَلَّ <em>that not</em>, and إِلَّا 
  for إِن لَّا <em>it not</em>; but عَمَّا <em>from what</em> is better so written for
  عَنْ مَا  as is إِمَّا for  إِنْ  مَا  <em>if</em> with نَا الزَّائِدَةُ <em>redundant mâ</em>
(see <a href="etymology.htm#sect353">§ 353</a>*).<br>
(c) With he letter ت after ظ ط ض ذ د ث in certain parts
  of the verb, as  أَرَدتُّ  <em>I wished</em>: this practice is, however, more
  than questionable.</br>
REM. b. If the verb ends in ت it naturally unites with a
second  ت  as نَبَّتَّ nabbattu <em>I sowed</em> or <em>planted</em> for نَبَّتْتُ </p>
<p><a id="sect15"><strong>15.</strong></a> Hamzaħ <em>compression (of upper part of windpipe)</em>  ء to
 which a 'alif most commonly serves as  عِمَادٌ 'imâd <em>support</em>, may
almost be reckoned by Europeans as the alphabet's initial consonant.
It is equivalent to the French h aspirée (which to English
sense is not, except in Normandy, sounded),and it may be
heard between the two words le onze and between la onzième.
If our own definite article be pronounced before a vowel as before
a consonant, we can only prevent liaison by employing hamzaħ;
thus thö 'orange (ö as E in the book). Arabs would transcribe
a nice house anaishaus but an'aishaus for an ice house.<br>
REM. a. When a connective 'alif (see <a href="#sect18">§ 18</a>) requires vowelling,
 the vowel mark is better written without hamazaħ, thus اَلْ <em>the</em>,
 اِبْنٌ  <em>son</em>  (see <a href="#sect19">§ 19</a>rem. d).<br>
REM. c. Hamzaħ is marked btween ا and sukûn or the
 following vowel; but we find  مَلَئِهِ  <em>his chiefs</em>,  خَاشِئينَ  <em>object</em>,
 and even  بَئشٌ  <em>griexous</em>.<br>
REM. d. Hamzaħ is most perceptible in the middle of a
word as  اَلْقُرْآنُ for (see <a href="#sect23">§ 23</a>)  اَلْقُرْأَانُ  al qur'ânu (not qurânu)
 <em>the Corân</em>.<br>
 REM. e. Hamzaħ and 'alif are called  أَلِفُ الْقَطْعِ  <em>the 'alif of severance</em>.</p>

<p>16. We have spoken in the preceding section of 'alif serving
<lb/>most commonly as 'imâd to hamzaħ; in certain circumstances this
<lb/>position may be taken by  وor ى the latter appearing without
<lb/>dots (see §§ 131 et seq., 238, 240, 316 d and 361 a rem.), thus
<lb/>  مُنْشِىءٌproducer.
<lb/>17. Hamzaħ alone, instead of ؤ إ أ or ىء is written,
<lb/>(a) always at a word's end, after sukûn or a letter of prolongation,
<lb/>as  جَاءَhe came,  سُوءٌevil,  مَجِيءٌa coming,  ظِمْءٌthirst;
<lb/>and in the middle of a word after 'alif of prolongation provided
<lb/>the hamzaħ bears fat[hdot]aħ as acc.  أَعْدَاءَكُمْyour enemies, but nom.
<lb/> أَعْدَآؤُكُمْ , dep. أَعْدآئِكُمْ 
<lb/>Note. For أَعْدَآءَكُمْ جَآءَ see § 22, and for  مَجِيءٌ سُوءٌsee
<lb/>§ 23 rem. c.
<lb/>(b) frequently in the middle of words after و or ي of prolongation
<lb/>and after sukûn, as  سُوءَىa mischief for مَشِيئَةٌ سُوؤَى 
<lb/>wish for  مَشِيئَةٌ يَسْئَلُ he asks for يَسْأَلُ ; also after kasraħ and
<lb/>[ddot]ammah before ي  or  وof prolongation;  خَاطِئينَkhâ⃛i'îna sinners
<lb/>for  رُءُوسٌ خَاطِئِينَru'ûsun heads for رُؤُوشٌ Sometimes it is
<lb/>improperly placed over the letter of prolongation, as خَطِيَةٌ for
<lb/>  خَطِيَةٌor خَطِيئَةٌ kha⃛î'aħun sin.
<lb/>REM. b. Hamzaħ may under certain circumstances be changed
<pb n="13"/>
<lb/>into a weak letter, as مِيةٌ for مِئَةٌ (see § 325 rem. a),  نَبِيُّfor
<lb/>  نَبِيءٌprophet, فَيٌّ for فَيْءٌ shade,  رَاسٌfor رَأْسٌ head بِيرٌ for بِئْرٌ a
<lb/>cistern,  أَالِهَةٌfor أَأْلِهَةٌ  gods,  أَامَنَّاfor  أَأْمَنَّاwe believed.
<lb/>NOTE. For  آمَنَّا آلِهَةٌsee § 23, and for  مَشِيئَةٌ سُوءَىrem. c.
<lb/>REM. c. The name  دَآءُودُDavid is always pronounced dâ'ûd
<lb/>however it may be written.
<lb/>18. Some Arabic words begin with connective 'alif over
<lb/>which is marked waçlaħ sign of union ~ hereinafter transliterated
<lb/>by hyphen, because the word and its predecessor are spoken as
<lb/>one; thus  عَبْدُ اللهِ 'abdu -llâhi servant of God,  وَادْعُوهُwa -d'ûhu
<lb/>and call ye upon Him.
<lb/>19. Elision takes place to form the union
<lb/>(a) with the vowel of  اَلْthe, as  يَوْمُ الدِّينِthe day of the judgment.
<lb/>NOTE. As regards  اَلَّذِيsee § 347.
<lb/>(b) in regular Imperatives of the first form, as  قَالَ اصْبِرْhe
<lb/>said, Be patient; instead of اِصْبِرْ 
<lb/>(c) in certain derivatives belonging to the seventh and following
<lb/>forms of the verbs (see § 35), as وَانْقَلَبُوا and they were
<lb/>changed; instead of اِنْقَلَبُوا 
<lb/>(d) in  اِبْنٌson,  اِثْنَانِtwo,  اِمْرَأَةٌa woman,  اِسْمٌname, and a
<lb/>few other nouns.
<lb/>REM. c. In most of these words the 'alif and vowel are prosthetic,
<lb/>i. e. prefixed to a vowelless initial consonant' for the sake
<lb/>of euphony (see § 26).
<pb n="14"/>
<lb/>REM. d. It is obviously an error t begin a sentence with~آ 
<lb/>in such case the connective 'alif is written without hamzaħ but
<lb/>with a vowel, as  اَلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِPraise belongs to God.
<lb/>REM. f. Waçlaħ and 'alif are called  أَلِفُ الْوَصْلِthe 'alif of union.
<lb/>20. The connective 'alif may follow
<lb/>(a) a short vowel, which then absorbs it (see § 18).
<lb/>(b) a long vowel, which is then shortened in pronunciation
<lb/>to comply with § 25; as  فِى الْأَرْضِfî -l 'ar[ddot]i to be read fil'ar[ddot]i
<lb/>in the earth  اِهْدِنَا الصِّراَطَihdinâ -l çirâ⃛a to be read ihdinaççirâ⃛a
<lb/>guide us (on) the way: but the suffixes of the 1st pers. sing.
<lb/>  يِand  نِيmay assume before the article the order forms
<lb/>  يand نِىَ as  أُدْخُلْ بِيَ الْبَيْتَcause me to enter the house,
<lb/>  ( آيَاتِي الَّذِينَ ) سَأَصْرِقُ عَنْ آيَاتِىَ الَّذِينَI will divert from
<lb/>my signs those who.
<lb/>(c) a diphthong, which usually is resolved into two simple
<lb/>vowels; but  أَوْor and لَوْ if take kasra, thus ضَمِيرُ التَّوْكِيدِ أّوِ 
<lb/>  التَّأْكِيدِ the pronoun of corroboration (see § 530).
<lb/>(d) sukûn over a consonant, which then most usually takes
<lb/>kasraħ, as  فِى الاِبْتِدَآءِfor  فِي الْ اِبْتِدَآءِin the beginning, مُحَمَّدٌ 
<lb/>  النَّبِيُّ(sometimes written مُحَمَّدٌ نِ النَّبِيُّ ) Mahomet the prophet
<lb/>pronounced mu[hdot]ammaduninnabîyu,  جُمْلَةٌ اسْمِيَّةٌa nominal sentence
<lb/>(see § 513)  وَلكِنِ انْظُرُbut look. The pronouns  أَنْتُمْyou,
<lb/>  هُمْthey; the suffixes  كُمْyour, you,  هُمْtheir, them; and the
<lb/>verbal termination  تُمْtake [ddot]ammaħ (in which they originally
<lb/>ended), as  لَعَنَهُمُ اللهُmay God curse them (see § 401 f) : also
<pb n="15"/>
<lb/>  مُذْsince because contracted for  مُنْذُwhereas  مِنْfrom (see
<lb/>§ 448) takes fat[hdot]aħ before the article and elsewhere kasraħ.
<lb/>REM. a. When  هُمْbecomes  هِمْ(see § 185 rem. b) the waçl
<lb/>may be made with [ddot]mmah  هِمُor kasraħ هِمِ 
<lb/>21. The ~ is altogether omitted
<lb/>(a) from  اِسْمٌin the formula  بِسْمِ اللهِfor  بِاسْمِ اللهِin the
<lb/>name of God, which by way of compensation is written بسم 
<lb/>(b) from  اِبْنٌin a genealogical series, with certain exceptions.
<lb/>(c) from  اَلْthe preceded by  لِto (see § 356 c) as لِلْبَيَانِ 
<lb/>certainly the man for لاِلرَّجُلُ . When three lâms occur one is
<lb/>omitted, thus  لِلَّهِto God for لِاللهِ 
<lb/>(d) from words preceded by the interrogative particle  (see
<lb/>§ 361 a).
<lb/>22 Maddaħ extension  ~does not admit of transliteration,
<lb/>being either superfluous or an abbreviation or marking an
<lb/>abbreviation. Thus it is customary to omit 'alif which, with
<lb/>hamzaħ and a vowel or tanwîn, follows a 'alif of prolongation;
<lb/>then by way of compensation maddaħ is written over the remaining
<lb/>'alif, as  سَآئِلٌone who asks for  جَآءَ شَاإِلٌhe came for جَاأض 
<lb/>  أَعْدَآءَكُمْyour enemies for أَعْدَاأّكُمْ 
<lb/>23. hamzaħ and 'alif آ also represent a 'alif with hamzah
<lb/>and fat[hdot]ah followed by 'alif of prolongation أَا or by 'alif with
<lb/>hamzah and sukûn  أَأْas  آلَhe returned for أَالَ ءَآلَ آيَةٌ،a sign,
<lb/>verse for  أَايَةٌfor  آلهِةٌ، أَوَيَةٌgods for آمَنَّا، أّأْلِهَةُ we believed for أّأْمّنَّا 
<lb/>  سَيِّآتٌfor  سَيِّئَاتٌplural of  سَيِّئَةٌan evil (see § 242 Note 2).
<pb n="16"/>
<lb/>REM. c. hamzaħ is sometimes placed over و and ي of prolongation
<lb/>when followed by hamzaħ, as سُوءَى، مَجِيءٌ، سُوءٌ 
<lb/>  مَشِيئَةٌit serves in manuscript to prevent hamzaħ appearing to
<lb/>be upon the letter of prolongation.
<lb/>REM. d. The same mark  ~ is written over abbreviations, as
<lb/>  الخto its end i.e. etcaetera (see § 451 c).
<lb/>24. An open syllable ends with a long or short vowel.
<lb/>25. A shut syllable ends with a consonant, and its vowel is
<lb/>most commonly short.
<lb/>26. A syllable cannot begin with two consonants: foreign
<lb/>words commencing so are transcribed by Arabian grammarians
<lb/>with an additional vowel, thus franks becomes إفْرِنْجُ Europeans
<lb/>pronounced colloquially faranj or farang.
<lb/>27. A syllable cannot end with two consonants, except
<lb/>  بِالْوَقْفِbi -l waqfi in pause, which ought to be made only when
<lb/>required by sense, but which is really more frequent; as لَهُ الَمُلْكْ 
<lb/>  وَلَهُ الْحَمْدْ(compare Elementary Arabic: First reading book,
<lb/>page 27 top line) to Him belong the dominion and the praise,
<lb/>witness alos the Moslem credo phonetically written as pronounced
<lb/>at Damascus  لَا إلهْ إلَّا اللهْ وَمُحَمَّدٌ لاَّسُولُ اللهْlâ'ilâh: 'illallâh:
<lb/>wamu[hdot]ammdurrasûlullâh There is no god but God and Mu[hdot]ammad
<lb/>is His apostle. In the Urdu translation of this book – will
<lb/>mark the shortest pause then, one of medium lenght and as in
<lb/>English the longest.
<lb/>NOTE. Professor de Goeje appends to vol ii § 95 f of Wright's
<lb/>Grammar an instructive footnote condemning pedantic speech,
<pb n="17"/>
<lb/>and he gives reference to a MS at Leyden. In fact case-endings
<lb/>are nearly always dropped in  اَلدَّارِجُal dârij current speech:
<lb/>throughout Arabia the proper name  اِبْنُ رَشِيدٍis pronounced
<lb/>ibrrashîd by Badawîn (Bedouins). The accusative is most often
<lb/>heard, as  مَرْحَبًاmar[hdot]abaû (see § 435 b) welcome pronounced in
<lb/>pause mar[hdot]abâ (see § 8 rem. a).
<lb/>28. The accent will not occasion difficulty to Englishmen
<lb/>who acquire pronunciation of Arabic consonants by reading the
<lb/>Corân aloud after a Moslem: it is designed to ensure grammatical
<lb/>accuracy; thus  يُسَبِّخُ(see Elementary Arabic: First
<lb/>reading book, page  26bottom line) is pronounced yusabbí[hdot]u for
<lb/>fear of saying yusábbi[hdot]û. Colloquial accentuation differs with
<lb/>the locality; thus  مُصْطَفَى اللهِmuç⃛afa -llâhi chosen of God is
<lb/>múç⃛afa in Syria, and in Egypt muç⃛áfa or even muç⃛âfa.
<lb/>32. Numbers were anciently expressed by letters whose
<lb/>numerical value may be learnt in the following order أَبْجَدْ هَوَّزْ 
<lb/>  حَطِّي كَلَمَنْ سَعْفَصْ قَرَشَتْ ثَخَذْ ضَظَغْsix consonants, forming
<lb/>the last two words, being supplementary to the Hebrew and
<lb/>Aramaic alphabets. Between the analysis and text of Elementary
<lb/>Arabic: First reading book will be found a Table, which gives
<lb/>the Phoenician, modern Hebrew, and other alphabets. The Arabic
<lb/>figures now employed are
<lb/> 0987654321 
<lb/>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
 <lb/>and they are used in our order, thus 983605 506389.</p>
