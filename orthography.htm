    <h2>ORTHOGRAPHY AND ORTHOËPY.</h2>
    
    <p><strong>1.</strong> Arabic is written from right to left with twenty-eight
    letters, all consonants; three of which, however, are also used as
    vowels. In modern alphabetical order they range as follows, each
     with the equivalent employed by Wright's <em>Arabic Grammar</em>:
the second equivalent (if any) is from <em>Elementary Arabic: First
reading book</em>; being easier for beginners, as Dr Wright discards
digraphs, i. e. two letters for the representation of one sound.</p>

<p>REM. a.  أ following ل forms لا  lâm' alif which is sometimes
reckoned as a letter.</p>
<p>REM. e.  ي  و  أ  are called  حُرُوفُ الْعِلَّةِ  <em>the weak letters.</em></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The orthoëpy, i.e correct pronunciation, of Arabic consonants
is most easily acquired by learning from a Moslem to read
the Corân alound. With the exception of minute and insignificant
divergencies this Corânic pronunciation is in theory identical
nearly* everywhere, though in India, and probably in countries
still more remote from Arabia, its distinctness has fallen off, and
still more remote letters, notabley  ع and  ح is lost. Further,
the Corân's vowelling is beyond dispute; and this is of more
advantage to beginners than they are at first capable of recognizing;
vowel- signs exits, and are used, for purposes of grammar
rather than to aid colloquial pronunciation. Slight indications
only as to Corânic pronunciation can here be given, together with
an explanation of the transliteration to be employed.</p>
<p><strong>b r f l m h </strong>are pronounced as in English, but r must be trilled and h
distinctly uttered, however placed: thus  مَهْدِيّ mahdîy <em>one
led aright</em> almost mahĭdîy, and  وَجْه wajh <em>face</em> like wajhĭ.</p>
<p><strong>t d</strong> sharper than in English, and with the tongue's tip, to
distinguish them from</p>
<p><strong>ṭ ḍ</strong> pronounced with broad of tongue, the tip being held against
the lower teeth.</p>
<hr>
<p>* A Turkish 'imâm will pronounce certain letters as in Turkish; thus
 kyâmil for  كَامِل kâmil <em>one who is perfect.</em></p>

<p><strong>ṯẖ</strong> as in thorn, thump; but th as in goatherd, lighthouse.</p>
<p><strong>j</strong> is pronounced (i) ĵ as in John Jim Jack at al Azhar (the
famous Cairo University), but (ii) at the mosques of
Damascus, Tunis and Algiers [jcaron] ز as s in usual, measure,
vision,and as z in azure, and j in adjoin, adjective, adjacent,
bijou; and g in lodge, prestige, singe. The former sound is
represented by Frenchmen with dj and by Germans with
dsch, if now we double  ج thus  سَجَّادَةٌ <em>a prayer-carpet</em>,
it is easy to say sa[jcaron][jcaron] âdaħ, but not saĵĵâdaħ:
the French [jcaron] of bijou is therefore more convenient. Turks
however pronounce this letter as ĵ, and (iii) most Egyptians
colloquially as the g of go, which last is the sound given in
Hebrew.</p>
<p><strong>ḥ</strong> can only be learned by ear: beginners must use h until they
catch the sound.</p>
<p><strong>ḵẖ</strong> has long been employed by Anglo- Indians for the final
sound, harshly said, of lough, loch; gh being required for
 غَيْن  ghain and ch wanted in Persian etc. for the final
consonant of beach, which were best transcribed bîc, i.e
with the Italian c in dolce: kh must sound as in blockhouse,
thickheaded. Be it observed that  خ is not a k but an h,
which cannot in Hebrew writing be distinguished from ح </p>
<p><strong>ḏẖ</strong> is as th in though, thee, this; being as 𝛿 of modern Greece:
but dh as in bedhangings, adhesion.</p>
<p><strong>ẓ</strong> is strictly th said far back: but usually as z pronounced
with the tongue's tip pressed against the lower teeth; then</p>
<p><strong>z</strong> must be sounded sharply to make a distinction.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong> sounds as in kiss:  مُسْلِم  <em>Moslem</em> (quasi-mosslem) is muslim
 the first syllable of which resembles that of muzzle -im
neither in vowel nor consonant. If hissed with the tongue's
tip s contrasts with</p>
<p><strong>ç </strong> which must be pronounced further back, and with broad of tongue.</p>
<p><strong>sẖ</strong> as in shore, wash; but sh as in mishap. For sh the French
use ch and Germans sch, which last represents in Dutch سخ skh.</p>
<p><strong>ʿ</strong> must be learnt by ear. The arrangement of throat is the
same as that required for ḥ [hdot] but without aspirate. To
mimic baby camels is best of all; otherwise one must repeat
words in which  عَيْن  ain occurs between two vowels, as
 فَعَلَ  fa'ala, <em>he did</em>,  فَعَلَتْ فَعَلْتَ فَعَلْتِ فَعَلْتُ etc. (see § 369, Table 1).</p>
<p><strong>gẖ</strong> is the sound o gargling; but gh as in foghorn with the Persian كَى gâf, thus كَه gh.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong in Arabia is commonly pronounced as g in go, and so may
be said at first; but the student will learn to harden g in
the direction of k, and must sound</p>
<p><strong>k</strong> very sharply in contrast. No one who can recite the Corân
like a Moslem at mosque will confuse  ك  and  ق  as do
uninstructed Europeans.</p>
<p><strong>n</strong> as in English,  نك nk being as in sank, sink; but  نب  nb
sounds mb, thus  مِنْبَر  <em>a pulpit</em>, called mimbar.</p>
<p><strong>w y </strong> are always consonants, as  وَزِير  wazîr <em>burden bearer</em>, سَوَاكِن 
 sawâkin <em>(Souakim) female inhabitants</em>,  يُوسُف  yûsuf <em>Joseph</em>;
but, as these three examples show,  ي و ا  are frequently
 letters of prolongation (see § 6).</p>
 <p><strong>ħ</strong> representing ة and  ـة  is sounded as h when final, and as
t when followed by a vowel: it is called  تَآءٌ مَرْبُوطَةٌ tâ'
  marbûṭaħ  <em>tied</em>, as distinguished from ت t,  تَآءٌ مَمْدُودَةٌtâ'
  mamdûdaħ <em>stretched</em> (see § 294 rem. b)</p>
 <hr width="50%">
 <p><strong>4.</strong> The vowels and diphthongs are as follows:</p>
 <p>  ــَـ      فَتْحَةٌ    a   as vowel sound in aunt, wan, thumb, hat.</p>
 <p>  ــِـ      كَسْرَةٌ    i   as vowel sound in pin, bit, gift.</p>
 <p>  ــُـ       ضَمَّةٌ    u   as vowel sound in push, bull, mustache.</p>
 <p>           ـَا     â   as vowel sound in father, hard.</p>
 <p>           يِ      î   as vowel sound in keep, beach, chief, seize.</p>
 <p>           وُ     û    as vowel sound in moon, rule, blue, you.</P>
  <p>         يِ       ai   as vowel sound in aisle, my, rule, sigh, die, I.</p>
  <p>         وَ      au    as vowel sound in thou, how, bough.</p>
   <p>        ىَ      a   is as â.</p>
   <p>         ً     an   tanwîn of fatḥaħ (see § 8).</p>
   <p>         ِ     in   tanwîn of kasraħ (see § 8).</p>
   <p>           ٌ    un   tanwîn of ḍammaħ (see § 8).</p>
   <p>        ىً      an   as an, but in pause as â (see § 27).</p>
   <p>      اٍ       a[ncirc ] as an, but in pause as â (see § 27).</p>
<p>REM. a. The three Arabic words above are names of the
 vowel-marks, the corresponding sounds being called كَسْرٌ فَتْحٌ and ضَمُّ </p>
  <p>REM. b. A vowel is called  حَرَكَةٌ <em>a motion</em>, its mark being
   termed  شَكْلٌ  <em>form</em> or <em>figure</em>, plural أَسْكَالٌ and  .شُكُولٌ  Hence
   a consonant when followed by a vowel is said to be  مُتَحَرِكٌ  <em>in motion</em>.</p>
   <p>strong>5.</strong>When the Corân is recited, each letter, whatever its
relative position, in theory represents the same sound; but in
practice certain consonants somewhat modify adjacent vowels,
for instance  ق ظ ط ض ص  cause â, following one of them, to
be sounded like the Scandinavian å, which we represent variously
in nor, saw, war, hall, wrath, ought, caught. As to the many
jargons which constitute colloquial Arabic, they show divergencies
too materials to be learnt from any book: pronunciation of each
of these spoken dialects (they are unwritten) is easy to an
Englishman who can read aloud the Corânic extracts of <em>Elementary
 Arabic: First reading book</em> uttering the consonants like a
Moslem at mosque; but it must be acquired by ear at the
particular locality simultaneously with all eccentricities of
 vocabulary and grammar*.</p>
 
 <hr>
  <p>*Attempts have been made to print the Maltese dialect of Arabic in
Roman character at Valetta, and by the Bible Society in London, but in
neither case does the work betray a knowledge of philology. Far more
scholarly is the following book, which will be found most useful on the
Lower Nile;—“The Modern Egyptian Dialect of Arabic. A Grammar, with
Exercises, Reading-Lessons and Glossaries, from the German of Dr K. Vollers
With numerous additions by the Author. Translated by F. C. Burkitt, M. A.,
  Trinity College. Cambridge: at the University Press, 1895.”</p>
 
 <p><strong>6.</strong> The long vowels â, î, û are indicated (see § 4) by marking
the corresponding short vowels before و ا and ي respectively,
  which are then called  حُرُوفُ الْمَدِّ  <em>letters of prolongation</em>.</p>
<p>REM.a. In certain common words â is indicated merely by
fatḥaħ; as  اللهُ  etc., which should properly be written with the
 perpendicular fatḥaħ, thus اَللُّهُ <em>God</em>,  هرُونُ  <em>Aaron</em>,  اَلرَّحْمنُ <em>the
 merciful</em>,  اَلسَّموَاتُ <em>the heavens</em>,  اَلْقِيمَةُ <em>the resurrestion</em>,  لكِنْ <em>but</em>,
 ذلِكَ <em>that</em>,  هذَا <em>this</em> etc.: the words  ثَلَاثٌ <em>three</em>,  ثَلَاثُونَ <em>thirty</em>,
 ثَمَانِيةٌ  <em>eight</em>,  ثَمَانُونَ  <em>eighty</em> and  إِسْرَئِيلُ  <em>Israel</em> are also written
 defectively, thus ثَمنُونَ ثَمنِيةٌ ثَلقُونَ ثَلثٌ and إِسْرَائِلُ </p>
