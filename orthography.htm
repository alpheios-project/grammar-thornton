    <h2>ORTHOGRAPHY AND ORTHOËPY.</h2>
    
    <p><strong>1.</strong> Arabic is written from right to left with twenty-eight
    letters, all consonants; three of which, however, are also used as
    vowels. In modern alphabetical order they range as follows, each
     with the equivalent employed by Wright's <em>Arabic Grammar</em>:
the second equivalent (if any) is from <em>Elementary Arabic: First
reading book</em>; being easier for beginners, as Dr Wright discards
digraphs, i. e. two letters for the representation of one sound.</p>

<p>REM. a. أ following ل forms لاlâm' alif which is sometimes
reckoned as a letter.</p>
<p>REM. e.  ي و أ are called  حُرُوفُ الْعِلَّةِ <em>the weak letters.</em></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The orthoëpy, i.e correct pronunciation, of Arabic consonants
is most easily acquired by learning from a Moslem to read
the Corân alound. With the exception of minute and insignificant
divergencies this Corânic pronunciation is in theory identical
nearly* everywhere, though in India, and probably in countries
still more remote from Arabia, its distinctness has fallen off, and
still more remote letters, notabley  ع and  ح is lost. Further,
the Corân's vowelling is beyond dispute; and this is of more
advantage to beginners than they are at first capable of recognizing;
vowel- signs exits, and are used, for purposes of grammar
rather than to aid colloquial pronunciation. Slight indications
only as to Corânic pronunciation can here be given, together with
an explanation of the transliteration to be employed.</p>
<p><strong>b r f l m h </strong>are pronounced as in English, but r must be trilled and h
distinctly uttered, however placed: thus  مَهْدِيّ mahdîy <em>one
led aright</em> almost mahĭdîy, and  وَجْه wajh <em>face</em> like wajhĭ.</p>
<p><strong>t d</strong> sharper than in English, and with the tongue's tip, to
distinguish them from</p>
<p><strong>>⃛ [ddot]</strong> pronounced with broad of tongue, the tip being held against
the lower teeth.</p>
<hr>
* A Turkish 'imâm will pronounce certain letters as in Turkish; thus
kyâmil for  كَامِل kâmil <em>one who is perfect.</em>

<p><strong>th</strong> as in thorn, thump; but th as in goatherd, lighthouse.</p>
<p><strong>j</strong> is pronounced (i) ĵ as in John Jim Jack at al Azhar (the
famous Cairo University), but (ii) at the mosques of
Damascus, Tunis and Algiers [jcaron] ز as s in usual, measure,
vision,and as z in azure, and j in adjoin, adjective, adjacent,
bijou; and g in lodge, prestige, singe. The former sound is
represented by Frenchmen with dj and by Germans with
dsch, if now we double  ج thus  سَجَّادَةٌ <em>a prayer-carpet</em>,
it is easy to say sa[jcaron][jcaron] âdaħ, but not saĵĵâdaħ:
the French [jcaron] of bijou is therefore more convenient. Turks
however pronounce this letter as ĵ, and (iii) most Egyptians
colloquially as the g of go, which last is the sound given in
Hebrew.</p>
<p><strong>ḥ[hdot]</strong> can only be learned by ear: beginners must use h until they
catch the sound.</p>
<p><strong>kh</strong> has long been employed by Anglo- Indians for the final
sound, harshly said, of lough, loch; gh being required for
 غَيْن  ghain and ch wanted in Persian etc. for the final
consonant of beach, which were best transcribed bîc, i.e
with the Italian c in dolce: kh must sound as in blockhouse,
thickheaded. Be it observed that  خ is not a k but an h,
which cannot in Hebrew writing be distinguished from ح </p>
<p><strong>dh</strong> is as th in though, thee, this; being as 𝛿 of modern Greece:
but dh as in bedhangings, adhesion.</p>
<p><strong>ẓ</strong> is strictly th said far back: but usually as z pronounced
with the tongue's tip pressed against the lower teeth; then</p>
<p><strong>z</strong> must be sounded sharply to make a distinction.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong> sounds as in kiss:  مُسْلِم  <em>Moslem</em> (quasi-mosslem) is muslim
 the first syllable of which resembles that of muzzle -im
neither in vowel nor consonant. If hissed with the tongue's
tip s contrasts with</p>
<p><strong>ç </strong> which must be pronounced further back, and with broad of tongue.</p>
<p><strong>sh</strong> as in shore, wash; but sh as in mishap. For sh the French
use ch and Germans sch, which last represents in Dutch
  سخ skh.</p>
<p><strong>ʿ</strong> must be learnt by ear. The arrangement of throat is the
same as that required for ḥ [hdot] but without aspirate. To
mimic baby camels is best of all; otherwise one must repeat
words in which  عَيْن  ain occurs between two vowels, as
 فَعَلَ  fa'ala, <em>he did</em>,  فَعَلَتْ فَعَلْتَ فَعَلْتِ فَعَلْتُetc. (see § 369,
Table 1).</p>
<p><strong>gh</strong> is the sound o gargling; but gh as in foghorn with the Persian كَى gâf, thus كَه gh.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong in Arabia is commonly pronounced as g in go, and so may
be said at first; but the student will learn to harden g in
the direction of k, and must sound</p>
<p><strong>k</strong> very sharply in contrast. No one who can recite the Corân
like a Moslem at mosque will confuse  ك  and  ق  as do
uninstructed Europeans.</p>
<p><strong>n</strong> as in English,  نك nk being as in sank, sink; but  نب  nb
sounds mb, thus  مِنْبَر  <em>a pulpit</em>, called mimbar.</p>
<p><strong>w y </strong> are always consonants, as  وَزِير  wazîr <em>burden bearer</em>, سَوَاكِن 
 sawâkin <em>(Souakim) female inhabitants</em>,  يُوسُف  yûsuf <em>Joseph</em>;
but, as these three examples show,  ي و ا  are frequently
letters of prolongation (see § 6).
